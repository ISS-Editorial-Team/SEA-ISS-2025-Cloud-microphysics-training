# Conclusions
This notebook introduces the reader to program statements that demonstration applications can use to access Fiats functionality for training a cloud microphysics surrogate model, or to perform batch inference using an aerosol surrogate.  After providing information on installing the requisite compiler (LLVM `flang`) and build system (`fpm`), the notebook walks the reader through the process of running simplified example proxy programs modeled after the demonstration applications. Related visualizations demonstrate the accuracy of the microphysics model trained by Fiats and the richness of the structures representable with the pretrained aerosol model.
